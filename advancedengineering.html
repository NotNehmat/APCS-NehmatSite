        <h2>Rocket</h2>
        <p>For this project, our goal was to design a paper rocket that could reach the highest altitude. We began with a basic paper model and made modifications to strengthen the nose and accommodate electronic components. We used Whitebox as a learning tool to better understand the rocket-building process, focusing especially on key elements like stability.

        Instead of sticking with paper, we decided to fully 3D print our rocket to test whether it could outperform the lighter paper version. However, this approach presented several challenges. To improve our design, we made changes to both the rocket's structure and the 3D printing process. One of the most noticeable features of our rocket is the fin arrangement, which was designed to make the rocket spin in flight, theoretically improving its stability. While this did offer some benefits, the overall weight of the rocket became a major issue. Additionally, since 3D-printed parts are not airtight, our rocket lost thrust due to air leakage. This affected both its ascent and descent; the rocket often became unstable, flipping around at apogee and on the way down.

        Although the data we collected was mostly accurate, the performance issues led us to consider reverting to a paper-based design. If we had continued with the 3D-printed version, improvements would have included sealing the rocket to prevent air loss and enhancing stability. Here is the link to our spreadsheet and our video of the rocket launch.

        <h2>Neopixel Project</h2>
        <p>Worked with Tai, to create a lightsaber, he worked on the electronics component and I worked on the handle. I used Fusion360 and it took me a lot of time, trial and error. Overall this is how our final model looked!</p>

       <p>Worked with Tai, to hack our Mark Rober project. We had a sand garden! Originally we wanted to make a pen holder to attach to the marble but we ended up not having enough time and our holder became a sand rake. Overall, we are happy with the result of our project!</p>
